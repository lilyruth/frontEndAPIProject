# Front End App

This is a front end app to demonstrate a profile and project endpoints with a client API. 

I had a choice of technologies and because I have recently been primarily working in vanilla JS, that is what I'm using. 

## What I learned 

- I've been wanting to learn how to incorporate an actual dark mode query for some time. I took this opportunity to learn how to do this. The '@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark)' query checks system settings. A toggle changes the class on the root to reverse. 

- I tested out Redux on this project, and it was definitely overkill. I just built the pages in the call instead. 

- In completing a SPA that does not use ANY libraries or frameworks, I learned why we have them. :) However, this was a great learning experience to help me get the fundamentals down of WHY libraries like React and Redux do what they do. 10/10 fantastic learning exercise.
